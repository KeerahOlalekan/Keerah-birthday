    <h2>A Letter To You</h2>
    <p>
      My dearest Keerah, <br><br>
      On this day, the world was gifted with someone extraordinary â€” you.  
      You are not just the girl I love â€” you are my muse, my warmth, my home.  
      Every moment with you is a melody, every memory we make is a verse in our love story.  
      <br><br>
      Your laughter has become the soundtrack of my days,  
      Your kindness â€” a compass to my soul.  
      I thank the universe every day that our paths crossed.  
      <br><br>
      On your birthday, I want to whisper forever into your heart â€”  
      that I love you more than words, more than stars, more than time.  
      <br><br>
      May this day bring you joy, as youâ€™ve brought me peace.  
      May love find you at every corner, and may your dreams bloom endlessly.  
      <br><br>
      Happy Birthday, my Queen Keerah. ðŸŽ‚ðŸŒ¸  
      With all my heart,  
      <br><br>
      â€” Yours, Kamaldeen ðŸ’–
